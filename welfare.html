								<h3>Welfare</h3>
								<p>Is welfare a permanent solution or a temporary fix to a monumental epidemic? The United States government has historically made attempts to give back to and benefit its people, especially those who are suffering economically.  But the system today, has some major holes in it, and some even call it a “broken system.” Welfare is becoming more and more expensive, and according to foxnews.com, “Welfare spending topped one trillion dollars in 2001” (Oct 2012, Pg. 1.) The system, broken or not, needs to have some major changes. What can the United States government do to fix this system? There is a plethora of good ideas circling the nation, but there are a few great ones that should be implemented immediately.


<br />                                    
<br />  Although some may claim it unconstitutional, welfare recipients must be tested to make sure they aren’t using taxpayer money to abuse their privileges by purchasing illegal narcotics or an excessive amount of alcohol. One of the easiest, and most common ways that people are abusing welfare is by not looking for work. The entire purpose of the 1996 welfare reform was to add a work requirement. If welfare recipients were required to work (or at least be looking for work), welfare wouldn’t become a way of life (Feulner, 2012). As the work requirement for welfare was removed, more and more people are beginning to go on welfare as a way of life. With more people being on welfare, the cost is constantly rising. Currently, the United States government is spending $1.33 on welfare for every $1 we spend on national defense. It is estimated that in 2022 the ratio will be $2.33 to $1 (Feulner, 2012). 
	
<br />
<br />  On the other hand, public welfare programs ensure that everyone’s basic needs of life are met.  Despite tremendous efforts and a giant employment, less than one percent of the United Sates population is getting monetary assistance from the United Sates Government. From 2007 until present day, only half of a million women and children have received monetary assistance from the United States government. Many companies have not be hiring, so the only way that some Americans can feed their starving children is through public welfare and food stamps.

<br />
<br />  To put the welfare system into perspective, consider the national debt. The United States is 17 trillion dollars in the hole. That is the most America has ever been in debt. According to studies, welfare spending in 2012 was likely to be around 973 billion dollars. There was a 36 percent increase in only four years and it is only continuing to rise (Burke, 2012). People need to begin working and the system needs to be changed so that those people who do work receive an incentive.	

<br />
<br />  Many struggling single mothers who are on welfare are using it appropriately on things such as groceries, bills, and other necessities. What is disturbing is the way that recipients are abusing it. Some of the money spent by these recipients are unnecessary. Jack Dolan, an LA Times reporter, reported that welfare recipients have been using their state-issued debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs in tribal casinos, poker houses and strip clubs (Banks, 2010). It is no wonder that American taxpayers are raging about our system. The welfare benefits should not be used in casinos or poker houses. The money of hard working Americans should not go towards someone blowing it in a slot machine. Americans have every right to be upset.

<br />
<br />  The welfare system has recently gone through changes for the worst. It started out as a sophisticated, beneficial program that made a lot of sense but has turned into something that some deem to be a waste of money that is only growing more expensive and getting out of hand. The country cannot let this continue and must make the changes mentioned above to the system. The welfare system needs to give recipients incentive to work, it can’t just be free money handed out by the government. The system also needs to drug test these recipients. If you have enough money to buy recreational drugs, you shouldn’t be accepting assistance from the government. The system also needs to require recipients to have some type of employment or effort towards employment. These changes will make a more effective and efficient welfare system, and save a lot of money in the process. This could be the first step towards not only a better welfare system, but also a better tomorrow and outlook for the future.
