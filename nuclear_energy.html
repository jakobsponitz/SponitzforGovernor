								<h3>Nuclear Energy</h3>
								<p>There are many different ways that energy is harvested, but one particular way is nuclear energy. Most of the time this is ruled out first do to unknown risks who it is one of the safest and most efficient ways of harvesting energy. Nuclear Energy should be considered one of the main sources for energy because its safer, more energy efficient, and it is more cost effective than other sources of energy.
<br />
<br />                                    
Most people think that nuclear power plants are scary or that they are going to blow up but this is not true. in a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan there have been zero casualties. A fox news broadcast stated, “Uranium produced and stored at nuclear power plants literally can't explode”. This just goes to show that nuclear energy really isn't as bad as people make it out to be and it is one of the safest forms of energy that anyone can get.
<br />
<br />                                    
According to Steve Connor, “A golf ball sized lump of uranium can supply enough energy for a typical person for their whole life, equivalent to 56 tanker trucks of natural gas or 800 elephant sized bags of coal”. This means that if we stopped trying to get coal and we tried to get more uranium for energy then we could be getting numerous times more. In a recent study done to show how much energy is being produced compared to the max amount of energy being produced in natural resources most of them were between 40 and 60 percent where as nuclear energy towered the rest with a solid 90 percent. This clearly shows how much more effective using power from nuclear energy is than other resources.
<br />
<br />                                    
Nuclear energy is one of the most cost effective resources to produce. after getting started nuclear energy practically pays for itself with its high production of energy that saves time and money to produce and it can produce energy that will last much longer than other natural resources. In 2007 the cost for producing nuclear energy was 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 2.4 cents for coal, 6.7 for natural gas and 10.2 for oil. This shows that it is far less cheaper to produce at barely over one dollar for almost a three day span compared to the competition. Due to its very low cost to produce it is being said that it will eventually take over oil in providing electricity in industries around the world.
<br />
<br />                                    
Nuclear power plants can have fatal accidents that can kill many people at once and more over time. In the Chernobyl Accident on April 26th, 1986 over 4000 people died due to either direct death or radiation poisoning and cancer caused by the nuclear meltdown. in the Kyshtym Accident within 32 years after the incident over 8000 people died due to the facility having a meltdown.
<br />
<br />                                    
Nuclear power plants make harmful waste that lasts a long time. Waste produced by nuclear power plants can take between 200 and 500 thousand years to go away. This could leave potential dangers for generations to come if they find out that we did something wrong when we were trying to deal with it. 
Even though these things happen there are different ways to prepare for both of them. we can put nuclear waste in places specially designed to hold them to make sure that nothing goes wrong with them in the future or now. We can also prevent casualties caused by nuclear meltdowns by preparing the workers better as well as training the workers better to make sure that they know what they are supposed to do.
<br />
<br />                                    
Overall nuclear energy is one of the safest, most environmentally friendly and cost effective ways to produce energy better than its competition like oil, coal and natural gasses. There may be some problems that we are running into now but with help these problems can be put to rest to assure the safety of its workers as well as the civilians around it. The united states as well as the rest of the world should definitely look at nuclear energy as the energy of the future due to its massive benefits overpowering its minor deficiencies.
