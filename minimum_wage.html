								<h3>Minimum Wage</h3>
								<p>Increasing the minimum wage can have many detrimental effects on our economy.
Therefore, the minimum wage of $8/hour in the state of Minnesota should not be increased. It shouldn’t be increased because of the negative effect it will have on businesses, it will reduce teen employment, and increase movement of product manufacturing jobs overseas.
<br />
<br />                                    
 If the minimum wage in Minnesota is increased, then our businesses will be negatively affected. Because businesses will now have to pay more money to all of their employees, up to $9.50 on August 1st, 2016, they will face higher operating costs to cover the $1.50 increase. And once business owners must pay more money in wages, they must increase their product price to counteract the increased operating costs in order to make a profit. As a result of increased product prices, business competition will be decrease because it will be more difficult to be profitable and therefore there will be less businesses to compete with each other. Also, many economists believe that a minimum wage increase will lead to less productivity because consumers wouldn’t want to buy as much product due to the increased prices. They also believe that some businesses may need to cut hours and even workers to save some of their money. One final point to emphasize is that businesses will have to pay much more than an extra $1.50/hour. They will have to pay more in payroll taxes, social security, and more in unemployment tax.
<br />
<br />                                    
Another point is that a minimum wage increase will reduce teen employment. The current estimated unemployment rate for teens 15 or older is at 10.8%, and in the last five years it has been as high as 21%. Teens’ desire to make money, especially during the summer, in jobs such as shops, restaurants, and amusement parks. Oriane Casale, a Minnesota state labor economist said, “With the tightening labor market, teens are going to be a hotter commodity than they’ve been in a while.” Currently in Minnesota, 43% of teens aged 16­19 hold jobs, and an additional 5% are searching for a job. If the minimum wage was raised, then the possibility of our teens not holding jobs would likely increase, and cause many teenagers to become unproductive, especially during the summer months. 
<br />
<br />                                                                        
One final negative about raising minimum wage is that it will increase product manufacturing overseas. Many companies in the United States produce their products in countries like China or Mexico. According to ABC News, over 60% of everything we currently buy in this country is made overseas. This is a bad thing to do because it steals American jobs and gives them to people in another country. Although laborers may work for a cheaper price overseas, losing American jobs will not help our economy prosper. In addition, products made overseas tend to have a lower quality than they would here in America. 
<br />
<br />                                                                        
Some people may say that increasing the minimum wage will create many more jobs and help the economy. Democrats are saying that increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 will create more over $22 billion in new economic activity, which equates to about 85,000 new full­time jobs. However, no evidence supports this from past minimum wage increases. Also, the current unemployment rate in Minnesota is 3.7%, and that will only increase if the minimum wage is increased as well. Overall, this is a risk that the state of Minnesota should not be willing to take at this moment.
<br />
<br />                                                                       
People who favor a minimum wage increase may say that a capitalist system wouldn’t result in fair pay. Capitalism is a system in which a country’s trade and industry are controlled by private owners, rather than the state. This is an effective system because it allows the business owners to get the wages that their workers receive based off of skill and education, not government mandated pay. In addition, the market determines what is a fair wage based on the supply and demand levels to meet consumer needs. This viewpoint would favor some government regulation of the pay so people aren’t living like those in a third world country, but the current economic state wouldn’t require government intervention. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Although some people say that increasing the minimum wage is a good action, I still believe that it should remain where it currently is because the increase can have many detrimental effects on our economy. The minimum wage shouldn’t be increased because it has negative effects on businesses, reduces teenage employment, and increases movement of product manufacturing jobs overseas. For these reasons, the minimum wage should not be increased so we can maintain Minnesota’s prosperity in the long run.
