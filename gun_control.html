								<h3>Gun Control</h3>
								<p>The question for years now is if we should ban guns completely? I personally
Think that would should have less gun regulations because it is written in the Constitution the second amendment the right to bear arms. Criminals will find a way to run. 
<br />
<br />            
Ever since the constitution gave the people the right to bear arms, it has been are right to carry them around and get any gun that we so please. So if we banned guns altogether it would be unconstitutional and go against what our country stands for. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Criminals will always find a way to get a gun even if they decide to get rid of guns completely. Which could potentially hurt the citizens who would have had a gun if they were not banned. Isn't it are right to protect ourselves, our family and our property so how could we possibly do this if guns are banned. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Banning guns completely could actually cause more crime than if we just leave it as it is now. Studies have shown that states that implemented conceal and carry laws reduce murders by 8.5% rapes by 5% aggravated assault by 7% and 3% for robbery. PhD. 
Lot calculated that 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes 60,000 aggravated assaults and 12,000 robberies have been prevented from conceal and carry so why would you ever want to take it away? 
<br />
<br />                                    
On the other hand criminals are more likely to carry a gun if they suspect that the victim will carry a gun. Public safety should also be left to the professionally qualified police officers not citizens with little to no training. Criminals are more likely to carry a gun when the are going to commit a crime because they suspect that the victim will also have a gun this is a valid reason why we might need to regulate guns more.  
<br />
<br />                                    
Leaving public safety to the citizens with little or no training would not be reasonable so that why we should just leave it to professionally qualified police officers.  In some states such as Maryland and Georgia you do not need to go through training to receive a conceal and carry permit that is why we should leave it to the law. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Although criminals are more likely to carry guns if they think that the victim may have one they were still going to commit a crime towards them so if we got rid of guns the victim wouldn't have a gun but the criminal would more than likely have some sort of weapon when he commits the crime. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Yet leaving the public safety may not be the greatest choice it is still there right to carry a gun and protect themselves their family and their property. It will also give them a better chance of survival if they have a conceal and carry. 
<br />
<br />                                    
Although many people want to put a stop to all guns, I believe that we need to protect our rights and go off the constitution. Crimes will not stop if we ban guns they will  actually get worse. For all of these reasons, we should be able to get guns when we want and be able to bring them where we want.
